# OVAL 2.0 - Interactive Video Platform

OVAL 2.0 is an interactive video platform designed to be integrated into a learning management system (LMS) via Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI). The web application is built with Laravel 10 and PHP 8.2. This README and upgrades from original Oval v1 (from fork [Argsen/oval](https://github.com/Argsen/oval)) was written in assistance with ChatGPT. This guide will help you set up the OVAL software for a development environment using Laravel Homestead, including the requirements and database migrations.
